NZBirder is an app to help people recognize New Zealand birds visually and by sound and record their observations with locations in the popular eBird format, ready for submission, that was available in the app store for iPhones between approximately 2014 and 2021.

As the repo name suggests, this was a somewhat unplanned development, with myself being both a novice in Objective-C programming as well as in observing and learning about birds.
To my credit, I ended up spending a lot of time with both of these two, but some parts of this repo do reflect how the development of the app was more in the style of a medieval castle, with multiple generations of ideas growing on top of older ideas, using new development methods etc.

The app was sold in the Apple App store and people were seemingly using it successfully. Ultimately though, after going through all those updates for what felt like many years (and generations of iOS), after Objective-C had fallen out of fashion in favour of Swift, and if felt as if XCode was doing everything to keep me from compiling my modified code, I stopped updating the app.
